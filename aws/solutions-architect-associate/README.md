## Preparation strategy

The syllabus of the exam covers a wide variety of topics, and it might be overwhelming to know where to begin.

For those unfamiliar with cloud computing concepts in generally, it is highly recommeded for them to read through the whitepaper [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/architecture/AWS_Well-Architected_Framework.pdf). The key takeaway from this paper would be good system design parameters such as reliabilty, security, cost-efficiency, performance, etc. If one has a solid grasp on these concepts and can relate to how they are embodied across key AWS services, they're more than ready to take the examination.

Like for most certifications, the number one strategy to successfully clear this exam is to enroll in at least one course (Recommendation below). Course creators generally have already done the hard work by collecting material and providing a structured learning path. If one's not sure on enrolling, then they can at least preview the courses to get a clear understanding on how to go about learning the various services.

Coming to the services themselves, the following are ones which would comprise of 85-90%+ of the questions:

- Storage
  - S3, EBS, EFS, Storage Gateway
- Compute
  - EC2 & Autoscaling, ELB, Lambda
 - Security
   - IAM, KMS, Cognito
 - Databases
   - RDS & Aurora, DynamoDB
 - Monitoring
   - CloudWatch, CloudTrail
 - Others
   - SQS, CloudFront
   
It's highly recommended for one to have some hands-on experience with the above services. After all, the goal should be for one to be able to apply their learnings in real world projects. 
Although it's quite impractical to go through official AWS documentation and whitepapers for most of these services, the AWS FAQs sections of individual services are worth checking out as the Q&A format provides a fresh perspective towards understanding of these services.
